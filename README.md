Uh oh! A mishap at the bot factory caused all your health to be at 1! Better hope you don't get hit by anything or anyone...

Press \ (Backslash) to toggle UI. 

Based on inspiration of the One Hit Hero badge from A Hat In Time, this mod makes it so you only have one health and one health only! You cannot heal via the health packs in the shop, or your friends.

This is my first mod using Harmony and BepInEx, so any feedback is appreciated!

# Known bugs:
- Upon starting a new game or loading a save, the max health will still be at the default (new game) or saved (load game). This cannot be fixed due to how REPO handles health saving, but your health will fix itself upon picking up a health pack or having a friend heal you.

- If a friend heals you, they'll lose 10HP and wont get refunded. There might be a fix for this later on, but for now, there is no fix planned.

- (Only applies if you have no "Last Loser Standing" mods.) If you reach the Last Loser Standing area, your health will be set to the default. This will not be fixed as you're all trying to kill each other anyway, so fixing this will not be a priority.

Be sure to visit the Github repo for any features you want to see added and I might do it.
